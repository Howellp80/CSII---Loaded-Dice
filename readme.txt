This is a simplified version of war, using dice instead of cards. There will
be only one user, but 2 “players” for the game. The user will indicate the number of rounds to play.
The user will also specify for each “player” the number of sides on the dice used and if that player is
using regular or loaded dice. For example one player could have a loaded 10-sided die while the other
has a regular 4-sided die. No one said it had to be fair!
